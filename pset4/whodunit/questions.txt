1.  stdint.h is a header file that includes special integer types that are useful in several programs
2.  because of these types, we can use specific space in a program
3.  BYTE = 1 byte
    DWORD = 4 bytes
    LONG = 4 bytes
    WORD = 2 bytes
4.  BM (ascii)
    0x4d42 (hex)
5.  bfsize is the number of bytes in the file, while bisize is the number of bytes in BITMAP INFO HEADER
6.  the origin is moved from upper left to lower left corner
7.  biBitCount
8.  if it does not find the input file it will return null, while if it cannot create the output file, it will again retrun null
9.  because it specifies how many elements to read
10. 3
11. it moves to the specified line of a file
12. A constant which, when used as the argument to the
    fseek function, specifies that the offset provided is relative to
    the current file position.
